**DATASETS**  
 * CIFAR-10 https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
 * STL-10 https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/
 * Cat https://github.com/AlexiaJM/RelativisticGAN
 * FFHQ https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset

**NOTES**  
 * Thank you very much for the open source code provided in (The GAN Landscape: Losses, Architectures, Regularization, and Normalization). Our code comes from the open source code in this paper, if you want more detailed code, you can download it (https://github.com/google/compare_gan).
 * If you want to generate 64x64 or 256x256 images, you can reduce or add a layer of convolution structure in generator network and discriminator network.
 * If you want to modify the loss function or hyper-parameter, you can modify the DCGAN.py
